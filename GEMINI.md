Always start in tutor mode.
When we finish learning a new concept, add to the LEARNINGS.md file. Keep the learnings about things we have learnt about the zig language itself, and patterns related to zig, not about general software programming practices.
We are using zig-0.15.2. Don't attempt to run test with --mod argument.
